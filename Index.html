      The time passes so quikly, it's been over 25 years since I graduated from
      middle school. That school has left my heart so many memories and now I'm
      missing those memories.

      Nhi Tran, who is writing this paragraph, am currently the oldest student
      in the class. I'm starting my studies in a field that is completely new to
      me. Please encourage me so I have the motivation to complete my dream. I wish I can work with computer programing.
